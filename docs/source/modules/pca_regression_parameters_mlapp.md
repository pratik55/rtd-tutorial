# Module Name: `PCA_regression_parameters.mlapp`
- **Module Category:** App Designer GUI module.
- **Theoretical Background:** Linear models use $y=X\beta+\varepsilon$; residualized data are $\hat{\varepsilon}=y-X\hat{\beta}$, with temporal means often added back. App Designer methods coordinate user interaction and inherit mathematical content from called WhiFuN routines.
- **Key Features:**
  - Properties that correspond to app components
  - Internal calls detected: No internal WhiFuN calls detected.
  - External dependencies detected: MATLAB App Designer
