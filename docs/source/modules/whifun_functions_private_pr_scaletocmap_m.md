# Module Name: `whifun_functions/private/pr_scaletocmap.m`
- **Module Category:** Private visualization/helper dependency.
- **Theoretical Background:** Overlap and stability use Dice $D(A,B)=\frac{2|A\cap B|}{|A|+|B|}$ and IoU $J(A,B)=\frac{|A\cap B|}{|A\cup B|}$.
- **Key Features:**
  - Scale image data to colormap, returning colormap indices FORMAT [img, badvals]=pr_scaletocmap(inpimg,mn,mx,cmap,lrn) Inputs inpimg - matrix containing image to scale mn - image value that maps to first value of colormap mx - image value that maps to last value of colormap cmap - 3xN colormap lrn - 1x3 vector, giving colormap indices that should fill: - lrn(1) (L=Left) - values less than mn - lrn(2) (R=Right) - values greater than mx - lrn(3) (N=NaN) - NaN values If lrn value is 0, then colormap values are set to 1, and indices to these values are returned in badvals (below) Output img - inpimg
  - Internal calls detected: No internal WhiFuN calls detected.
  - External dependencies detected: No major external dependency pattern detected beyond MATLAB base language.

## Function: `pr_scaletocmap()`
- **Signature & Definition:** `function [img, badvals]=pr_scaletocmap(inpimg,mn,mx,cmap,lrn)` (line 1)
- **Scientific Theory & Formulas:** Overlap and stability use Dice $D(A,B)=\frac{2|A\cap B|}{|A|+|B|}$ and IoU $J(A,B)=\frac{|A\cap B|}{|A\cup B|}$.
- **Functional Purpose:** Scale image data to colormap, returning colormap indices FORMAT [img, badvals]=pr_scaletocmap(inpimg,mn,mx,cmap,lrn) Inputs inpimg - matrix containing image to scale mn - image value that maps to first value of colormap mx - image value that maps to last value of colormap cmap - 3xN colormap lrn - 1x3 vector, giving colormap indices that should fill: - lrn(1) (L=Left) - values less than mn - lrn(2) (R=Right) - values greater than mx - lrn(3) (N=NaN) - NaN values If lrn value is 0, then colormap values are set to 1, and indices to these values are returned in badvals (below) Output img - inpimg scaled between 1 and (size(cmap, 1)) badvals - indices into inpimg containing values out of range, 
- **Arguments:**
  - `inpimg` (MATLAB value inferred from source usage): Inferred from the signature, variable name, and source usage; precise validation occurs at MATLAB runtime.
  - `mn` (MATLAB value inferred from source usage): Inferred from the signature, variable name, and source usage; precise validation occurs at MATLAB runtime.
  - `mx` (MATLAB value inferred from source usage): Inferred from the signature, variable name, and source usage; precise validation occurs at MATLAB runtime.
  - `cmap` (numeric scalar, vector, matrix, or multidimensional array): Inferred from the signature, variable name, and source usage; precise validation occurs at MATLAB runtime.
  - `lrn` (MATLAB value inferred from source usage): Inferred from the signature, variable name, and source usage; precise validation occurs at MATLAB runtime.
- **Returns:**
  - `img` (MATLAB value inferred from source usage): Output produced by the MATLAB implementation.
  - `badvals` (MATLAB value inferred from source usage): Output produced by the MATLAB implementation.
- **Dependencies:**
  - Calls: No internal WhiFuN calls detected in this function body.
  - External: No major external dependency pattern detected beyond MATLAB base language.
  - Called By: `whifun_functions/whifun_paint.m:1/whifun_paint`
- **Edge Cases & Exceptions:** Defines defaults or branches for optional arguments or missing files. Handles NaN, Inf, or finite-value filtering. Raises MATLAB errors for invalid dimensions, missing files, invalid parameters, or failed commands.
