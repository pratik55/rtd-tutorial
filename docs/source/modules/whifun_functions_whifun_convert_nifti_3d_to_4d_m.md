# Module Name: `whifun_functions/whifun_convert_nifti_3d_to_4d.m`
- **Module Category:** WhiFuN first-party MATLAB function.
- **Theoretical Background:** Band-pass filtering uses Butterworth IIR coefficients; forward-backward `filtfilt` cancels phase delay and squares the magnitude response. Data-management code preserves participant provenance, BIDS/custom path mapping, and reproducible bookkeeping.
- **Key Features:**
  - WHIFUN_CONVERT_NIFTI_3D_TO_4D Combines a series of 3D NIfTI volumes into a single 4D NIfTI file (e.g., creating a functional time series from individual 3D volumes). A = WHIFUN_CONVERT_NIFTI_3D_TO_4D(FOLDER, FILTER, TR, OUT_FILENAME, ATLAS) This function is useful for aggregating individual 3D image acquisitions (e.g., single time points from a scanner) into the standard 4D time series format. Input Arguments: FOLDER - The directory path containing the 3D NIfTI files. FILTER - The common filename pattern (wildcard) to match the 3D NIfTI files (e.g., 'f*.nii'). TR - The Temporal Resolution (Rep
  - Internal calls detected: No internal WhiFuN calls detected.
  - External dependencies detected: MATLAB NIfTI I/O

## Function: `whifun_convert_nifti_3d_to_4d()`
- **Signature & Definition:** `function a = whifun_convert_nifti_3d_to_4d(folder,filter,TR,out_filename,atlas)` (line 1)
- **Scientific Theory & Formulas:** Band-pass filtering uses Butterworth IIR coefficients; forward-backward `filtfilt` cancels phase delay and squares the magnitude response. Data-management code preserves participant provenance, BIDS/custom path mapping, and reproducible bookkeeping.
- **Functional Purpose:** WHIFUN_CONVERT_NIFTI_3D_TO_4D Combines a series of 3D NIfTI volumes into a single 4D NIfTI file (e.g., creating a functional time series from individual 3D volumes). A = WHIFUN_CONVERT_NIFTI_3D_TO_4D(FOLDER, FILTER, TR, OUT_FILENAME, ATLAS) This function is useful for aggregating individual 3D image acquisitions (e.g., single time points from a scanner) into the standard 4D time series format. Input Arguments: FOLDER - The directory path containing the 3D NIfTI files. FILTER - The common filename pattern (wildcard) to match the 3D NIfTI files (e.g., 'f*.nii'). TR - The Temporal Resolution (Repetition Time) in seconds. This value is written to the 4th dimension of the NIfTI header's PixelDime
- **Arguments:**
  - `folder` (character vector or string scalar filesystem path): Inferred from the signature, variable name, and source usage; precise validation occurs at MATLAB runtime.
  - `filter` (MATLAB value inferred from source usage): Inferred from the signature, variable name, and source usage; precise validation occurs at MATLAB runtime.
  - `TR` (numeric scalar or numeric vector): Inferred from the signature, variable name, and source usage; precise validation occurs at MATLAB runtime.
  - `out_filename` (character vector or string scalar filesystem path): Inferred from the signature, variable name, and source usage; precise validation occurs at MATLAB runtime.
  - `atlas` (numeric image/header data, commonly X x Y x Z or X x Y x Z x T): Inferred from the signature, variable name, and source usage; precise validation occurs at MATLAB runtime.
- **Returns:**
  - `a` (MATLAB value inferred from source usage): Output produced by the MATLAB implementation.
- **Dependencies:**
  - Calls: No internal WhiFuN calls detected in this function body.
  - External: MATLAB NIfTI I/O
  - Called By: No internal caller detected by static scan; entry point, callback, script-local function, or externally invoked routine.
- **Edge Cases & Exceptions:** Defines defaults or branches for optional arguments or missing files. Checks empty arrays, missing files, or empty user selections.
