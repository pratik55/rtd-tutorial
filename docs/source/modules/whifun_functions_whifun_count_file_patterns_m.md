# Module Name: `whifun_functions/whifun_count_file_patterns.m`
- **Module Category:** WhiFuN first-party MATLAB function.
- **Theoretical Background:** Registration uses affine coordinates $x_{world}=M[x\;1]$ and, for normalization, deformation fields; SPM coregistration uses normalized mutual information for multimodal alignment. Data-management code preserves participant provenance, BIDS/custom path mapping, and reproducible bookkeeping.
- **Key Features:**
  - WHIFUN_COUNT_FILE_PATTERNS Audits dataset structure by counting file naming patterns. Author: Pratik Jain This function recursively scans a directory and identifies unique file naming patterns by abstracting subject-specific IDs (sub-XXXX) into wildcards (sub*). It is designed to validate BIDS-compliant datasets. INPUTS: dataset_path - String. The root directory of your fMRI dataset. OUTPUTS: pattern_table - A table containing: * Name: The abstracted file path and pattern. * Value: The total count of files matching that pattern. EXAMPLE: % Check if all 20 subjects have their MNI-space bold fil
  - Internal calls detected: No internal WhiFuN calls detected.
  - External dependencies detected: No major external dependency pattern detected beyond MATLAB base language.

- **Arguments:**
  - `dataset_path` (character vector or string scalar filesystem path): Inferred from the signature, variable name, and source usage; precise validation occurs at MATLAB runtime.
- **Returns:**
  - `pattern_table` (MATLAB value inferred from source usage): Output produced by the MATLAB implementation.
- **Dependencies:**
  - Calls: No internal WhiFuN calls detected in this function body.
  - External: No major external dependency pattern detected beyond MATLAB base language.
  - Called By: `whifun_functions/whifun_plot_important.m:1/whifun_plot_important`
- **Edge Cases & Exceptions:** No explicit defensive branch was detected; incompatible inputs will fail through MATLAB runtime behavior.
