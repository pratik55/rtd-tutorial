# Module Name: `whifun_functions/whifun_extract_csf_ts.m`
- **Module Category:** WhiFuN first-party MATLAB function.
- **Theoretical Background:** Tissue masks use label or probability thresholding. Group consensus includes voxel $v$ when $S^{-1}\sum_s I_s(v)\ge\tau$. Data-management code preserves participant provenance, BIDS/custom path mapping, and reproducible bookkeeping.
- **Key Features:**
  - WHIFUN_EXTRACT_CSF_TS Extracts the CSF time series from a functional scan. WHIFUN_EXTRACT_CSF_TS(in_csf_mask_func_path, now_func_path, pca_for_temp_reg, n_pca) extracts the time series of all voxels within a Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) mask from a functional neuroimaging data file. The function first reads the binary CSF mask and the functional data. It then reshapes both to a voxel x time points matrix to efficiently extract all the CSF time series. The function handles two methods for summarizing the time series: 1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: If `pca_for_temp_reg` is true, the fun
  - Internal calls detected: No internal WhiFuN calls detected.
  - External dependencies detected: MATLAB NIfTI I/O, MATLAB table/file I/O, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, SPM12

- **Functional Purpose:** WHIFUN_EXTRACT_CSF_TS Extracts the CSF time series from a functional scan. WHIFUN_EXTRACT_CSF_TS(in_csf_mask_func_path, now_func_path, pca_for_temp_reg, n_pca) extracts the time series of all voxels within a Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) mask from a functional neuroimaging data file. The function first reads the binary CSF mask and the functional data. It then reshapes both to a voxel x time points matrix to efficiently extract all the CSF time series. The function handles two methods for summarizing the time series: 1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: If `pca_for_temp_reg` is true, the function performs PCA on the CSF time series and saves the first `n_pca` principal components. This is 
- **Arguments:**

  - `now_func_path` (character vector or string scalar filesystem path): Inferred from the signature, variable name, and source usage; precise validation occurs at MATLAB runtime.
  - `pca_for_temp_reg` (logical or numeric flag): Inferred from the signature, variable name, and source usage; precise validation occurs at MATLAB runtime.
  - `n_pca` (numeric scalar or numeric vector): Inferred from the signature, variable name, and source usage; precise validation occurs at MATLAB runtime.
- **Returns:**
  - No explicit return variable; outputs are files, figures, GUI state, console text, or modified structures.
- **Dependencies:**
  - Calls: No internal WhiFuN calls detected in this function body.
  - External: MATLAB NIfTI I/O, MATLAB table/file I/O, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, SPM12
  - Called By: `whifun_functions/whifun_extract_csf_ts_preproc.m:1/whifun_extract_csf_ts_preproc`
