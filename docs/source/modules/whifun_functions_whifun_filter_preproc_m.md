# Module Name: `whifun_functions/whifun_filter_preproc.m`

## Description
- **Module Category:** WhiFuN first-party MATLAB function.
- **Theoretical Background:** Band-pass filtering uses Butterworth IIR coefficients; forward-backward `filtfilt` cancels phase delay and squares the magnitude response. Data-management code preserves participant provenance, BIDS/custom path mapping, and reproducible bookkeeping.
- **Key Features:**
  - WHIFUN_FILTER_PREPROC Performs bandpass filtering on functional data. [Subj_list_1, out_func_path] = WHIFUN_FILTER_PREPROC(...) is a high-level function that manages the bandpass filtering step of fMRI preprocessing. Filtering removes unwanted high-frequency physiological noise and low-frequency scanner drift, isolating the BOLD signal of interest. The function performs the following steps: 1. **Check Existence**: It checks if a pre-filtered file already exists. Based on the `over_write` flag, it either skips the process or creates a new file. 2. **Load Data**: It loads the functional data and

### Description
WHIFUN_FILTER_PREPROC Performs bandpass filtering on functional data. [Subj_list_1, out_func_path] = WHIFUN_FILTER_PREPROC(...) is a high-level function that manages the bandpass filtering step of fMRI preprocessing. Filtering removes unwanted high-frequency physiological noise and low-frequency scanner drift, isolating the BOLD signal of interest. The function performs the following steps: 1. **Check Existence**: It checks if a pre-filtered file already exists. Based on the `over_write` flag, it either skips the process or creates a new file. 2. **Load Data**: It loads the functional data and the brain mask into the workspace. 3. **Design Filter**: It uses the `butter` function to design a

### More About
Band-pass filtering uses Butterworth IIR coefficients; forward-backward `filtfilt` cancels phase delay and squares the magnitude response. Data-management code preserves participant provenance, BIDS/custom path mapping, and reproducible bookkeeping.

### Tips
Uses try/catch; failures are logged, displayed, or returned. Handles NaN, Inf, or finite-value filtering. Checks empty arrays, missing files, or empty user selections. Raises MATLAB errors for invalid dimensions, missing files, invalid parameters, or failed commands.
