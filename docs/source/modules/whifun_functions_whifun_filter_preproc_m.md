# Module Name: `whifun_functions/whifun_filter_preproc.m`
- **Module Category:** WhiFuN first-party MATLAB function.
- **Theoretical Background:** Band-pass filtering uses Butterworth IIR coefficients; forward-backward `filtfilt` cancels phase delay and squares the magnitude response. Data-management code preserves participant provenance, BIDS/custom path mapping, and reproducible bookkeeping.
- **Key Features:**
  - WHIFUN_FILTER_PREPROC Performs bandpass filtering on functional data. [Subj_list_1, out_func_path] = WHIFUN_FILTER_PREPROC(...) is a high-level function that manages the bandpass filtering step of fMRI preprocessing. Filtering removes unwanted high-frequency physiological noise and low-frequency scanner drift, isolating the BOLD signal of interest. The function performs the following steps: 1. **Check Existence**: It checks if a pre-filtered file already exists. Based on the `over_write` flag, it either skips the process or creates a new file. 2. **Load Data**: It loads the functional data and

## Function: `whifun_filter_preproc()`
- **Signature & Definition:** `function [Subj_list_1,out_func_path] = whifun_filter_preproc(quality_control_path,Subj_list_1,in_func_path,in_func_mask_path,filter_lp,filter_hp,f_pre,log_fileID,over_write)` (line 1)
- **Scientific Theory & Formulas:** Band-pass filtering uses Butterworth IIR coefficients; forward-backward `filtfilt` cancels phase delay and squares the magnitude response. Data-management code preserves participant provenance, BIDS/custom path mapping, and reproducible bookkeeping.
- **Functional Purpose:** WHIFUN_FILTER_PREPROC Performs bandpass filtering on functional data.

Filtering removes unwanted high-frequency physiological noise and low-frequency scanner drift, isolating the BOLD signal of interest. The function performs the following steps: 1. **Check Existence**: It checks if a pre-filtered file already exists. Based on the `over_write` flag, it either skips the process or creates a new file. 2. **Load Data**: It loads the functional data and the brain mask into the workspace. 3. **Design Filter**: It uses the `butter` function to design a
