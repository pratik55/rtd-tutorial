# Module Name: `whifun_functions/whifun_qc_coreg_orthoslice.m`
- **Module Category:** WhiFuN first-party MATLAB function.
- **Theoretical Background:** Registration uses affine coordinates $x_{world}=M[x\;1]$ and, for normalization, deformation fields; SPM coregistration uses normalized mutual information for multimodal alignment. Visualization modules use slice sampling, overlays, contours, colormaps, and surface or graph rendering without adding a separate inferential model. Data-management code preserves participant provenance, BIDS/custom path mapping, and reproducible bookkeeping.
- **Key Features:**
  - WHIFUN_QC_COREG_ORTHOSLICE Creates a quality control image for coregistration. WHIFUN_QC_COREG_ORTHOSLICE(image_1_path, image_2_path, out_image_path, caption_1, caption_2) generates a quality control image to visually inspect the alignment of two neuroimaging files (e.g., a functional image and an anatomical image) after coregistration. The function uses SPM's `spm_check_registration_evalc` and `spm_orthviews` to create a plot showing three orthogonal slices of `image_2` with an overlay contour of `image_1`. This visual check is essential for verifying the accuracy of the coregistration step. 
  - Internal calls detected: `spm_check_registration_evalc`
