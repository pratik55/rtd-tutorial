# Module Name: `whifun_functions/whifun_qc_csf_mask_alignment.m`
- **Module Category:** WhiFuN first-party MATLAB function.
- **Theoretical Background:** Tissue masks use label or probability thresholding. Group consensus includes voxel $v$ when $S^{-1}\sum_s I_s(v)\ge\tau$. Visualization modules use slice sampling, overlays, contours, colormaps, and surface or graph rendering without adding a separate inferential model. Data-management code preserves participant provenance, BIDS/custom path mapping, and reproducible bookkeeping.
- **Key Features:**
  - WHIFUN_QC_CSF_MASK_ALIGNMENT Generates a quality control figure for CSF mask alignment. WHIFUN_QC_CSF_MASK_ALIGNMENT(out_folder, func_image_path, CSF_mask_func_path, name, slover_slices_ss, slover_contour_range_ss, slover_view, over_write) creates visual quality control reports to assess the alignment of the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) mask with the functional data for a given subject. The function generates two types of plots: 1. **SPM Orthoslice Plot**: It uses SPM's `check_registration` to create a plot. The functional image is used as the underlay, and the CSF mask is used as the overlay. Th

## Function: `whifun_qc_csf_mask_alignment()`
- **Signature & Definition:** `function whifun_qc_csf_mask_alignment(out_folder,func_image_path,CSF_mask_func_path,name,slover_slices_ss,slover_contour_range_ss,slover_view,over_write)` (line 1)

- **Functional Purpose:** WHIFUN_QC_CSF_MASK_ALIGNMENT Generates a quality control figure for CSF mask alignment. WHIFUN_QC_CSF_MASK_ALIGNMENT(out_folder, func_image_path, CSF_mask_func_path, name, slover_slices_ss, slover_contour_range_ss, slover_view, over_write) creates visual quality control reports to assess the alignment of the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) mask with the functional data for a given subject. The function generates two types of plots: 1. **SPM Orthoslice Plot**: It uses SPM's `check_registration` to create a plot. The functional image is used as the underlay, and the CSF mask is used as the overlay. This provides a visual check of how well the CSF mask aligns with the brain ventricles in the function
