# Module Name: `whifun_functions/whifun_qc_head_motion.m`
- **Module Category:** WhiFuN first-party MATLAB function.
- **Theoretical Background:** Framewise displacement is commonly $FD_t=\sum_{i=1}^{3}|\Delta d_{i,t}|+R\sum_{i=1}^{3}|\Delta\theta_{i,t}|$, with $R=50\,\mathrm{mm}$. Visualization modules use slice sampling, overlays, contours, colormaps, and surface or graph rendering without adding a separate inferential model. Data-management code preserves participant provenance, BIDS/custom path mapping, and reproducible bookkeeping.
- **Key Features:**
  - WHIFUN_QC_HEAD_MOTION Generates a quality control figure for head motion. WHIFUN_QC_HEAD_MOTION(out_folder, realigned_func_native, ..., motion_txt) creates a comprehensive quality control report for head motion for a single subject. The report consists of four plots combined into a single figure. The function performs the following steps: 1. **Check Existence**: It checks if a head motion QC image already exists and, based on the `over_write` flag, either skips or generates a new one. 2. **Calculate Metrics**: It reads the realigned functional data and the motion parameter file. It then calcul
  - Internal calls detected: `whifun_create_file`
  - External dependencies detected: MATLAB NIfTI I/O, MATLAB table/file I/O

## Function: `whifun_qc_head_motion()`
- **Signature & Definition:** `function whifun_qc_head_motion(out_folder,realigned_func_native,name,max_fd,mean_fd,greater_than_20,over_write,motion_txt)` (line 1)

- **Functional Purpose:** WHIFUN_QC_HEAD_MOTION Generates a quality control figure for head motion. WHIFUN_QC_HEAD_MOTION(out_folder, realigned_func_native, ..., motion_txt) creates a comprehensive quality control report for head motion for a single subject. The report consists of four plots combined into a single figure. The function performs the following steps: 1. **Check Existence**: It checks if a head motion QC image already exists and, based on the `over_write` flag, either skips or generates a new one. 2. **Calculate Metrics**: It reads the realigned functional data and the motion parameter file. It then calculates: - **Global Mean**: The scaled global signal mean over time. - **Pairwise Variance**: A measure
