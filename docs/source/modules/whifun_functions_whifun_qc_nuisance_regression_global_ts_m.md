# Module Name: `whifun_functions/whifun_qc_nuisance_regression_global_ts.m`

## Description
- **Module Category:** WhiFuN first-party MATLAB function.
- **Theoretical Background:** Linear models use $y=X\beta+\varepsilon$; residualized data are $\hat{\varepsilon}=y-X\hat{\beta}$, with temporal means often added back. Framewise displacement is commonly $FD_t=\sum_{i=1}^{3}|\Delta d_{i,t}|+R\sum_{i=1}^{3}|\Delta\theta_{i,t}|$, with $R=50\,\mathrm{mm}$. Visualization modules use slice sampling, overlays, contours, colormaps, and surface or graph rendering without adding a separate inferential model.
- **Key Features:**
  - WHIFUN_QC_NUISANCE_REGRESSION_GLOBAL_TS Generates a global time series QC plot for nuisance regression. WHIFUN_QC_NUISANCE_REGRESSION_GLOBAL_TS(...) creates a visual quality control report to assess the effect of nuisance regression on the mean global signal of a functional scan. The function performs the following steps: 1. **Check Existence**: It checks if the output plot already exists and, based on the `over_write` flag, either skips or generates a new one. 2. **Data Loading**: It reads the functional data before and after nuisance regression. It also loads the motion parameters and the CS
  - Internal calls detected: `whifun_create_file`, `whifun_niftiread`
  - External dependencies detected: MATLAB NIfTI I/O, MATLAB table/file I/O, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

### Description
WHIFUN_QC_NUISANCE_REGRESSION_GLOBAL_TS Generates a global time series QC plot for nuisance regression. WHIFUN_QC_NUISANCE_REGRESSION_GLOBAL_TS(...) creates a visual quality control report to assess the effect of nuisance regression on the mean global signal of a functional scan. The function performs the following steps: 1. **Check Existence**: It checks if the output plot already exists and, based on the `over_write` flag, either skips or generates a new one. 2. **Data Loading**: It reads the functional data before and after nuisance regression. It also loads the motion parameters and the CSF covariates (either PCA components or the mean time series). 3. **Plotting**: It creates a single p

### More About
Linear models use $y=X\beta+\varepsilon$; residualized data are $\hat{\varepsilon}=y-X\hat{\beta}$, with temporal means often added back. Framewise displacement is commonly $FD_t=\sum_{i=1}^{3}|\Delta d_{i,t}|+R\sum_{i=1}^{3}|\Delta\theta_{i,t}|$, with $R=50\,\mathrm{mm}$. Visualization modules use slice sampling, overlays, contours, colormaps, and surface or graph rendering without adding a separate inferential model.

### Tips
Defines defaults or branches for optional arguments or missing files. Checks empty arrays, missing files, or empty user selections. Emits warnings for recoverable conditions.
