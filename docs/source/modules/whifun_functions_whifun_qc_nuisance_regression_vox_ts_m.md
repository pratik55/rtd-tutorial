# Module Name: `whifun_functions/whifun_qc_nuisance_regression_vox_ts.m`

## Description
- **Module Category:** WhiFuN first-party MATLAB function.
- **Theoretical Background:** Linear models use $y=X\beta+\varepsilon$; residualized data are $\hat{\varepsilon}=y-X\hat{\beta}$, with temporal means often added back. Visualization modules use slice sampling, overlays, contours, colormaps, and surface or graph rendering without adding a separate inferential model. Data-management code preserves participant provenance, BIDS/custom path mapping, and reproducible bookkeeping.
- **Key Features:**
  - WHIFUN_QC_NUISANCE_REGRESSION_VOX_TS Generates quality control figures for nuisance regression. WHIFUN_QC_NUISANCE_REGRESSION_VOX_TS(out_folder1, Subj_list_1, ...) creates visual quality control reports to assess the effectiveness of nuisance regression. The function focuses on time series plots and mask visualizations. The function performs the following steps: 1. **Check Existence**: It checks if the before- and after-regression time series plots already exist and, based on the `over_write` flag, either skips or generates new ones. It also creates the necessary output directories. 2. **Time

  - External dependencies detected: SLover/MarsBaR-style visualization helpers

### Description
WHIFUN_QC_NUISANCE_REGRESSION_VOX_TS Generates quality control figures for nuisance regression. WHIFUN_QC_NUISANCE_REGRESSION_VOX_TS(out_folder1, Subj_list_1, ...) creates visual quality control reports to assess the effectiveness of nuisance regression. The function focuses on time series plots and mask visualizations. The function performs the following steps: 1. **Check Existence**: It checks if the before- and after-regression time series plots already exist and, based on the `over_write` flag, either skips or generates new ones. It also creates the necessary output directories. 2. **Time Series Plots**: It calls a helper function `whifun_ts_qc` to generate time series plots of key brain

### Output Arguments
- No explicit return variable; outputs are files, figures, GUI state, console text, or modified structures.

### More About
Linear models use $y=X\beta+\varepsilon$; residualized data are $\hat{\varepsilon}=y-X\hat{\beta}$, with temporal means often added back. Visualization modules use slice sampling, overlays, contours, colormaps, and surface or graph rendering without adding a separate inferential model. Data-management code preserves participant provenance, BIDS/custom path mapping, and reproducible bookkeeping.

### Tips
Defines defaults or branches for optional arguments or missing files. Checks empty arrays, missing files, or empty user selections.
