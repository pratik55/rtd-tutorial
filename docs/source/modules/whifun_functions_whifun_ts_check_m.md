# Module Name: `whifun_functions/whifun_ts_check.m`
- **Module Category:** WhiFuN first-party MATLAB function.
- **Theoretical Background:** Registration uses affine coordinates $x_{world}=M[x\;1]$ and, for normalization, deformation fields; SPM coregistration uses normalized mutual information for multimodal alignment. Visualization modules use slice sampling, overlays, contours, colormaps, and surface or graph rendering without adding a separate inferential model. Data-management code preserves participant provenance, BIDS/custom path mapping, and reproducible bookkeeping.
- **Key Features:**
  - WHIFUN_TS_CHECK Generates a comprehensive time series quality check figure. WHIFUN_TS_CHECK(func_path_raw, func_path_pro, txt_path, in_anat_mni_mask_path, out_func_mni_mask_path, out_image_path, Reg_, csf_covariate_path, n_pca, pca_for_temp_reg) creates a multi-panel figure to visually inspect the effect of the preprocessing pipeline on a subject's functional time series. The function provides a detailed comparison of data quality before and after key preprocessing steps. The function generates ten plots in a 2x5 grid: - **Global Mean (Raw)**: The mean signal of the raw data. - **Pairwise Vari
  - Internal calls detected: `whifun_calculate_fd`, `whifun_niftiread`
  - External dependencies detected: MATLAB NIfTI I/O, MATLAB table/file I/O, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

## Function: `whifun_ts_check()`
- **Signature & Definition:** `function whifun_ts_check(func_path_raw,func_path_pro,txt_path,in_func_mni_mask_path,out_image_path,Reg_,csf_covariate_path,n_pca,pca_for_temp_reg)` (line 1)
- **Scientific Theory & Formulas:** Framewise displacement is commonly $FD_t=\sum_{i=1}^{3}|\Delta d_{i,t}|+R\sum_{i=1}^{3}|\Delta\theta_{i,t}|$, with $R=50\,\mathrm{mm}$. Registration uses affine coordinates $x_{world}=M[x\;1]$ and, for normalization, deformation fields; SPM coregistration uses normalized mutual information for multimodal alignment.
