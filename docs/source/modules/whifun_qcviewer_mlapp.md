## `MNIorNATIVEsegmentationValueChanged()`

### Syntax
```matlab
function MNIorNATIVEsegmentationValueChanged(app, event)
```
Defined at source line `593`.

### Description
Properties that correspond to app components

### Examples
No runnable examples were extracted during the source-static review for this function.

### Input Arguments
#### `app` — MATLAB App/UI object or callback handle
Inferred from the signature, variable name, and source usage; precise validation occurs at MATLAB runtime.

#### `event` — MATLAB App/UI object or callback handle
Inferred from the signature, variable name, and source usage; precise validation occurs at MATLAB runtime.

### Name-Value Arguments
No explicit name-value arguments were documented in the source-static review for this function.

### Output Arguments
- No explicit return variable; outputs are files, figures, GUI state, console text, or modified structures.

### More About
Registration uses affine coordinates $x_{world}=M[x\;1]$ and, for normalization, deformation fields; SPM coregistration uses normalized mutual information for multimodal alignment. Tissue masks use label or probability thresholding. Group consensus includes voxel $v$ when $S^{-1}\sum_s I_s(v)\ge\tau$. Visualization modules use slice sampling, overlays, contours, colormaps, and surface or graph rendering without adding a separate inferential model. App Designer methods coordinate user interaction and inherit mathematical content from called WhiFuN routines.

### Tips
No explicit defensive branch was detected; incompatible inputs will fail through MATLAB runtime behavior.

```matlab
function finalFuncViewOptions(app, event)
```
Defined at source line `925`.

### Description
Properties that correspond to app components

### Examples
No runnable examples were extracted during the source-static review for this function.

### Input Arguments
#### `app` — MATLAB App/UI object or callback handle
Inferred from the signature, variable name, and source usage; precise validation occurs at MATLAB runtime.

#### `event` — MATLAB App/UI object or callback handle
Inferred from the signature, variable name, and source usage; precise validation occurs at MATLAB runtime.

### Name-Value Arguments
No explicit name-value arguments were documented in the source-static review for this function.

### Output Arguments
- No explicit return variable; outputs are files, figures, GUI state, console text, or modified structures.

### More About
Visualization modules use slice sampling, overlays, contours, colormaps, and surface or graph rendering without adding a separate inferential model. App Designer methods coordinate user interaction and inherit mathematical content from called WhiFuN routines.

### Tips
No explicit defensive branch was detected; incompatible inputs will fail through MATLAB runtime behavior.
